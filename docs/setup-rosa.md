## Setup ROSA

### AWS Configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
This configuration is set on AWS web console. We will need to get **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in this step.

1. Click on search bar in the upper left hand corner and search for `IAM`.
2. On the left hand side, click `Users` and then click your username.
3. Click the `Security credentials` secion and click `Create access Key`.
4. Copy and save the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, it will be used later in the process.

More information [here] ([**Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey)) from AWS doc.

```sh

```

### Verify your credentials and quota

If you are getting some error, please check your AWS account or the `aws configure`.    

### Deploy the cluster
```sh
rosa create account-roles --mode auto --yes
```
```sh
rosa create cluster --cluster-name <cluster-name> --sts --mode auto --yes
```
For more information, please refer to [https://www.rosaworkshop.io/rosa/2-deploy/](https://www.rosaworkshop.io/rosa/2-deploy/) to deploy the cluster on AWS.

### Create an Admin user
